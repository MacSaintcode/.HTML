                        <p id="texta">Hi My Name is Makanjuola Eniola Damilola, I am an introverted Christian who loves programming and playing games. 
                            I find solace in the quiet moments of life, where I can reflect on my thoughts and ideas.
                             I am a firm believer in the power of faith and the importance of living a life that is guided by Christian values.
                             When it comes to programming, I am passionate about creating new things and solving problems. I love the challenge of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new things.
                            </p>
                        <p id="texta">
                            Gaming is another one of my passions. I love the way games can transport you to different worlds and allow you to experience things you never thought possible.
                             Whether itâ€™s playing with friends or exploring new worlds on my own, gaming is a way for me to unwind and relax and here you can find some of the games 
                             i play to relax <a id="links" href="my hobbies.html">Hobbies </a>.
                        </p>
                        <p id="texta">
                            As an introvert, I tend to be more reserved and introspective. I enjoy spending time alone, reading books, and listening to music.
                             I am not one to seek out large crowds or social events, but I value the relationships I have with those closest to me.
                        </p>
                        <p id="texta">
                            Overall, I am a Christian programmer and gamer who values faith, creativity, and personal growth.
                             I am always looking for ways to improve myself and the world around me, and I believe that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible.
                        </p>
